# Project AligNN

## 1. Enviroment setup
    The setup of fCWT computing environment is not quite easy, so I write it down on a dockerfile in root directory, make sure that your machine are connected with internet, installed docker and run command below:

```shell
    # Replace the words in the bracket by your own choice
    docker build -t <name of this building image>
```
